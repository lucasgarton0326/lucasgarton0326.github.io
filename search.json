    "text": "It all started the year before they had barely avoided relegation by only six points. With 29 matches played Leicester sat the bottom of the table and all looked lost, before they rattled of sting of matches that included a four-game win streak only to be broken by champions that year Chelsea.\nWhat made Leicester so successful the following year was a multitude of things. After finishing the prior season with a negative goal differential of –9. The Fox’s turned into one of the best goal scoring offenses in the Premier League as well as becoming a fortress in defense.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(worldfootballR)\n\ntable<-read.csv(\"~/Desktop/Homework/SPMC 350/blogspmc350/posts/leicstercitypost/2015-2016premierleague table.csv\")\n\ngoals<-table%>%group_by(Squad, GF, GA)\nlc<-goals%>% filter(Squad== \"Leicester City\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=goals, \n    aes(x=GF, y=GA, size=Pts),\n    alpha = .2) + \n  scale_size(range = c(2, 9), name=\"Points\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=lc, \n    aes(x=GF, y=GA, size=Pts),color=\"blue\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 51.3) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 51.3) +\n  geom_text(data=lc, aes(x=GF, y=GA+2),color=\"blue\", label=\"Leicester City\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=60, y=60, label=\"Good Offense, Bad Defense\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=40, y=40, label=\"Good Defense, Bad Offense\"), color=\"black\") +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Goals Scored\", \n    y=\"Goals Against\", \n    title=\"Leicester was one of the best teams on both sides of the ball.\", \n    subtitle=\"The foxes kept goal scoring pace with the big clubs in England while not allowing many goals.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Refernce | By Lucas Garton\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nLeicester didn’t exactly dominate opponents on their way to their first Premier League title.

Jamie Vardy was the leading goal scorer for the Fox’s and set the record for most games scored in a row at 11 during the season. Mahrez led the league in assists.\n\n\nCode\nbig5_player_standard <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year= c(2016), stat_type= \"standard\", team_or_player= \"player\")\n\nprem<-big5_player_standard%>%\n  filter(Comp==\"Premier League\")%>%\n  mutate(points= Gls+Ast)%>%\n  filter(points>0)\n\njv<-prem%>% filter(\n  points==30)\nrm<-prem%>% filter(\n  points==28)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=prem, \n    aes(x=points, y=Min_Playing)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=jv, \n    aes(x=points, y=Min_Playing),color=\"blue\")+\n    geom_point(\n    data=rm, \n    aes(x=points, y=Min_Playing),color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(data=jv, aes(x=points-1, y=Min_Playing+120),color=\"blue\", label=\"Jamie Vardy\") +\n  geom_text(data=rm, aes(x=points, y=Min_Playing-120),color=\"blue\", label=\"Riyad Mahrez\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Goals + Asists\", \n    y=\"Minutes Played\", \n    title=\"Leicester's frontline was prolific in 2015-2016.\", \n    subtitle=\"The Fox's offense was lead by Vardy and Mahrez who lead the legue in points\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Refernce | By Lucas Garton\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the all the goals scored by the prolific tandem for Leicester one thing stands out when looking at the numbers. When it comes to penalties awarded and penalties scored Leicester was awarded the most with 13 and scored the most with 10. Compared to other clubs the penalties stand out the second most in Manchester City.

    "section": "",
    "text": "To say the least Germany were one of if not the favorites to win the World Cup in 2018. Germany’s group seemed a favorable one for them being drawn with Mexico, Sweden and South Korea. They had a mix of young talent such as Julian Draxler and Timo Werner and cagey vets that had been in the previous World Cup squad that won the tournament in Mats Hummels, Toni Kroos and Manuel Neuer.\nComing in with all the momentum in the world Germany didn’t even get out of the group stage and actually finished last in it. So, what went so wrong between the two World Cups?\nLooking at 2014 Germany and 2018 Germany a couple things stand out. Germany in 2014 scored goals and lots of them compared to 2018 Germany, who could barely even get any across the line. Also is that 2018 Germany dominated possession in their three games averaging over 70% despite being undermanned in one of their games.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\ngermanystats<-read.csv(\"~/Desktop/Homework/SPMC 350/blogspmc350/posts/Germanysworldcupfailure/wc2014&2018.csv\")\n\nnewgermanystats<-germanystats%>%filter(Squad == \"2014 Germany\" | Squad==\"2018 Germany\")%>%\n  mutate(\"Possession\" =Poss/100)%>%\n  select(Squad, Age,MP,Possession, per90Gls,per90Ast, Gls, Ast, CrdY, CrdR)\n\nnewgermanystats%>% gt()%>%\n  cols_label(\n    MP = \"Matches Played\",\n    per90Gls = \"Goals per Match\",\n    per90Ast = \"Assists per Match\",\n    Gls = \"Goals\",\n    Ast = \"Assists\",\n    CrdY = \"Yellow Cards\",\n    CrdR = \"Red Cards\"\n  ) %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How does 2014 Germany compare with 2018 Germany?\",\n    subtitle = \"2014 Germany had no problem scoring Goals while 2018 couldn't put anything in the back of the net.\"\n  ) %>%  \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Lucas Garton  |  **Source:** Sports Reference\")\n  ) %>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\",size=24, align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %>%\n  opt_row_striping() %>% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")%>%\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(Possession),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"green\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Squad == \"2014 Germany\",\n      columns = \"per90Gls\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      How does 2014 Germany compare with 2018 Germany?\n    \n    \n      2014 Germany had no problem scoring Goals while 2018 couldn't put anything in the back of the net.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Squad\n      Age\n      Matches Played\n      Possession\n      Goals per Match\n      Assists per Match\n      Goals\n      Assists\n      Yellow Cards\n      Red Cards\n    \n  \n  \n    2014 Germany\n26.6\n7\n57.9%\n2.35\n1.57\n18\n12\n1\n0\n    2018 Germany\n27.2\n3\n71.7%\n0.67\n0.67\n2\n2\n3\n1\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Lucas Garton  |  Source: Sports Reference\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at the box scores for 2018 Germany they had plenty of chances to score. In 2018 they were expected to score around 5.5 goals in their three games. In reality they only scored two. Both of the goals coming in their only win of the tournament against Sweden. The difference between goals expected and goals was the second worse in the tournament.\n\n\nCode\nwc2018<-read.csv(\"~/Desktop/Homework/SPMC 350/blogspmc350/posts/Germanysworldcupfailure/2018worldcupsquadstats.csv\")\n\nnewwc2018<-wc2018%>%mutate(plusminusXG = Gls-xG)\nger<-newwc2018%>%filter(Squad == \"Germany\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=newwc2018, \n    aes(y=reorder(Squad,plusminusXG),x=xG, xend=Gls),\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\") + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=ger,\n    aes(y=reorder(Squad,plusminusXG),x=xG, xend=Gls),\n    colour = \"black\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\") +\n  labs(title = \"Germany way underperformed its expected goals tally\",\n       subtitle = \"Germany was in the red when copmapring actuall goals(green) to expected goals(red).\", \n       x=\"Goals\", \n       y=\"\",\n       caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Lucas Garton\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nGermany performed better in the goalkeeping department. Manuel Neuer won the award for best goalkeeper in the 2014 World Cup and continued to perform in the 2018 tournament. Despite that it wasn’t up to par with the other goal keepers in the tournament within his group. Ochoa the best goalkeeper in Mexico’s history had one the best performances at the World Cup keeping El Tri in it with his many saves and Sweden’s’ Olsen averaged less goals against then Neuer.\n\n\nCode\nstats<-read.csv(\"~/Desktop/Homework/SPMC 350/blogspmc350/posts/Germanysworldcupfailure/2018goaliestats.csv\")\n\nmex<-stats%>%filter(Squad == \"Mexico\")\nger<-stats%>%filter(Squad == \"Germany\")\nswe<- stats%>%filter(Squad == \"Sweden\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=stats, \n    aes(x=GA90, y=Savepercentage)\n    ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=mex, \n    aes(x=GA90, y=Savepercentage), color= \"green\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=swe, \n    aes(x=GA90, y=Savepercentage), color= \"blue\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=ger, \n    aes(x=GA90, y=Savepercentage), color= \"yellow\") +\n  geom_text(data=mex, aes(x=GA90, y=Savepercentage+2), label=\"Ochoa\") +\n  geom_text(data=ger, aes(x=GA90, y=Savepercentage+2), label=\"Neuer\") +\n  geom_text(data=swe, aes(x=GA90, y=Savepercentage-2), label=\"Olsen\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Goals against per match\", \n    y=\"Save%\", \n    title=\"Geremnay's goalkeeping was average for the tournament\", \n    subtitle=\"The two teams that got out of Germany's group were just better between the sticks.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Lucas Garton\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, Germany may had a problem that many teams at the World Cup seem to run into and that is they don’t have a true goal scorer. None of the forwards that Germany brought within them managed to score a goal. They also got unlucky they had the chances and couldn’t convert them. Germany also had a brick wall in goal just the other teams in their group had a better one."
